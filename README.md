# Li-Ion-Relaxation-Prognostics

This repository contains the machine learning models implemented in Python 3 for state of health estimation of Li-ion batteries in the paper "*Data-Driven Lithium-Ion Battery State-of-Health Estimation Using Voltage Relaxation Statistics with Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks*", published in the Journal of The Electrochemical Society. 

If you use the code in your research, please cite the paper as:

*Sahajpal K, Chhabra H, Rana KPS, Kumar V. Data-Driven Lithium-Ion Battery State-of-Health Estimation Using Voltage Relaxation Statistics with Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks. J Electrochem Soc 2026. https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ae3257.*

Running the code only requires an elementary knowledge of Python. But to experiment with model implementation and hyperparameter optimization, you might need to refer to the documentation of the associated libraries (Pytorch, numpy, optuna, etc.).
